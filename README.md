# Airmouse iOS client

Airmouse is an app that runs on iOS and communicates with a MacOSX application. It allows an iPhone to control the position of the cursor on the screen, in a similar fashion to a Wii remote. Uses a Bluetooth protocol to communicate with the computer to send translational and rotational information.
